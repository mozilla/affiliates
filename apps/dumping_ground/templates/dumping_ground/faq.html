              Firefox Affiliate buttons are a bit of html
              code that you put on your website or blog to encourage
              visitors to your site to download Firefox. When a visitor
              to your site clicks on a button on your site and downloads
              Firefox, you get credit for that download. Affiliates who
              get a lot of downloads through their site will be featured
              on our leaderboard and be elegible for fun stuff like
              Firefox T-shirts. While we do send out prizes and gifts to
              our affiliates from time to time, Firefox Affiliates does
              not offer monetary rewards for hosting Firefox buttons.

            It's easy! Start at the button picker, select the Firefox
            product or campaign that you'd like to support, pick your
            button style, shape and color, then copy and paste the
            code into the html of your site. Your unique affiliate ID
            will be in that code, so that you get credit for every
            download you send our way.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            {% trans %}

            This is also easy. Simply delete the code. If you want to
            put it back in again, just copy and paste it from the
            button picker.

            Sometimes we run special time-limited campaigns to
            encourage people to download Firefox. If you're using an
            affiliate button for one of these campaigns, try to update
            your button as soon as you can. People who click on that
            button will be directed to a general Firefox download
            page. You'll get credit for the download as an affiliate,
            but you may not get credit for downloads for that specific
            campaign.

            your progress.

            have a rewards program and more opportunities to
            participate in affiliate challenges.

            Not yet... but soon. We're working on a way to make it
            easy for people to create their own Firefox buttons in
            their language. Look for this in future versions of
            Firefox Affiliates.
